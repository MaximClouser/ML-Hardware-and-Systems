# ML-Hardware-and-Systems  
This repo includes four projects from my ML Hardware and Systems (ECE 5455) course
that I completed during the Spring of 2024.  

## A1  
This assignment explores the analysis of computational and memory capabilities across different hardware platforms using roofline models. It includes benchmarking and visualization of performance metrics for various deep neural networks (DNNs) on CPUs, GPUs, ASICs, and SoCs. The tasks involve generating roofline plots, determining FLOPs/s and memory bandwidth, and assessing DNN performance and hardware utilization under diverse workloads.

## A2  
This assignment delves into training and deploying an audio processing neural network on an Arduino Tiny Machine Learning Kit. The project spans various stages including preprocessing, model size estimation, training, and deep dives into quantization and pruning to enhance performance. The tasks involve comprehensive coding, creating roofline plots, and performing benchmarking and hardware utilization analyses to optimize DNNs for efficient operation on microcontrollers.

## A3  
In this assignment, TVM is used to optimize deep neural network (DNN) primitives on various hardware platforms, including CPU, GPU, and FPGA devices. The project involves optimizing operations such as 1D convolution and GEMM, and performing multiple distinct optimizations to enhance performance.

## A4  
This assignment explores various implementations of convolution and linear layers using different mathematical transformations and factorizations. It includes implementing techniques such as im2col, Winograd, FFT, SVD, and log-domain matrix multiplication. The project investigates the accuracy and speedup implications of these approaches, particularly under low precision. The assignment involves comprehensive coding, numerical precision analysis, and performance benchmarking to understand the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.
